##### A Deep Bidirectional LSTM Powered Sentiment Analysis Model running in a flask supported Webapp which Predicts the Sentiment and Emotional Probability of text data that is Fed In !!!!!!!!
#### This model can be saved and deployed in the web and it took approximately 25 hours to train 1,157,825 parameters and it hosts an Accuracy rate of  84.75% 

##### Also I have used a package called preprocess_js which you can download using the command below:

`pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/js-stark/Preprocess_package_NLP.git`

How to Use??

`--> First Download the zip file and Extract the files init.
 --> Once files are extracted open the project in any editor such as spyder, atom etc.
 --> Make sure that all the required packages and imports specified in the app.py file are installed.
 --> Run the app.py file and copy the port address and paste it in your browser.
 --> Now you could see the Magic.
 --> If you further wish to deploy it in the wideweb you can use Docker containers to compile and Microsoft Azure to publish.`
